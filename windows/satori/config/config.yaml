# P2P Networking Mode
# Options: central (default), hybrid (P2P with central fallback), p2p (pure P2P)
# hybrid: Recommended for migration - uses P2P for peer communication with central server as fallback
# p2p: Pure P2P mode - fully decentralized, no central server dependency
networking mode: central

# Oracle Configuration (Advanced)
# Enable this to run as an oracle that publishes observation data to the network

# Prediction Protocol Settings
# Controls how predictions are submitted in P2P/hybrid mode
predictions:

# Reward Configuration
# Controls how mining rewards are claimed
rewards:
